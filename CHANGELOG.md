## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **skill-candidates.yaml merge behavior** — instead of overwriting on each run, the skill now merges new candidates into the existing file, deduplicating by source/name. This preserves previously discovered pending candidates across runs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Initial skill-discovery release** — daily discovery of new Claude Code skills and adjacent AI/agent tools. Diffs GitHub findings against `skills-registry.yaml`, scores candidates, writes a shortlist to `skill-candidates.yaml`, and sends a Telegram message for user approval.
- **Project-aware skill home** — the skill detects its host project's home directory at runtime, so the same install works under `~/.claude/skills/skill-discovery/`, `~/.openclaw/skills/skill-discovery/`, or any other `<root>/skills/<name>/` layout. State files (`skills-registry.yaml`, `skill-candidates.yaml`, `log/`) always live directly under that resolved home.
- MIT license, `.gitignore` for macOS and Windows system files, and a README usage guide noting the `tg_send` caveat.
